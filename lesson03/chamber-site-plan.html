                <p>Angelo's Pizza is a member of the local chamber of commerce. They are opening a second location
                    inside the tri-Hampton boundaries. They would like to have a grand opening ribbon-cutting ceremony
                    to promote the new location. The chamber will help them organize and perform the event and have
                    local township leaders there to show they support the business.</p>

                <h3>Local Doctor Offices</h3>
                <p>There are a lot of doctor offices in the tri-Hampton community. They want to have retreats two times
                    a year to have discussions on their practices and new research. They connect with the Tri-Hampton
                    Chamber of Commerce to look for locations that would offer discounts for their events.</p>

                    of small business grants offered by the tri-Hampton Chamber of Commerce and have applied for the
                    money.</p>
