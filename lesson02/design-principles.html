            <h2>Visual Hierarchy</h2>
            <h3>Playstation</h3>

            <p>Visual Hierarchy is the way of organizing elements, vectors, or logos on a page, so that the user has a
                clear understanding of the importance of the website and it's purpose. It is created using color and
                contrast, a scale, and the grouping of elements such as images, titles, and structures. Visual Hierarchy
                is important, because it serves as a role for drawing attention with a spotlight or focal point to what
                the website or any business is trying to advertise or show. An example of visual hiearchy. An example is
                the Playstation Official Website. This shows caption of many games that are released for the console
                along with their captions on the main home page.</p>

            <h2>White Space</h2>
            <h3>Apple</h3>
            <a href="https://www.apple.com/">apple.com</a>
            <img src="images/apple_whitespace.png" alt="whitespace_apple">
            <p>White space is the negative or empty space used around the contents of a web page. It's main purpose is
                to improve the visual experience for the users. Without whitespace, it may be more complicated to read
                text or titles, see any footage or images on a screen clearly, and keep the content of the page itself
                organized. Whitespace should be used in web pages that does not contain lots of content. An example of
                whitespace is on the Apple website. Apple is a perfect example of using whitespace, because they content
                on their page only contains their products and it is easy to understand and see what each one is.</p>

            <h2>Rule of Thirds</h2>
            <h3>The Franklin Institute</h3>
            <a href="https://www.fi.edu/en">fi.edu</a>
            <img src="images/franklininst_ruleofthirds.png" alt="rulethirds_frank">
            <p>The Rule of Thirds is a way of aligning content with using two horitzontal and two vertical lines to
                divide the design into nine equal portions. Each portion occupies 33.3% of each of those given spaces.
                Most websites that are designed use the Rule of Thirds to properly display each component properly
                aligned and organized. This is important, because the content on each website needs to be in a certain
                position to avoid any overflow of any layers of text, or layers, or otherwise it will not display each
                of those properly. A perfect example is the content on the Franklin Institute website. Each portion of
                content on the page is displayed so that they are leveled with each one of the lines that are part of
                the Rule of Thirds.</p>
